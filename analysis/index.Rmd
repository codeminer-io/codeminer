Notes on adapting raw lookup and mapping tables for `codemapper` (see also [pkgdown site](pkgdown_site/index.html))

# Lookup tables

-   [ICD10 lookup table](icd10_lkp.html)

# Mapping tables

-   [ICD9 to ICD10](icd9_icd10_mapping.html)
-   [Read 2 to Read 3](read2_read3_mapping.html)
-   [Read 2 to ICD10](read2_icd10_mapping.html)
-   [Read 3 to ICD10](read3_icd10_mapping.html)

# Work in progress

- [Reformat `all_lkps_maps`](reformat_all_lkps_maps.html)
