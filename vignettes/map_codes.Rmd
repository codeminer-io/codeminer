```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,

```

```{r setup}
library(codemapper)
library(dplyr)

all_lkps_maps_dummy <- build_all_lkps_maps_dummy()
```

# Basic usage

Use `map_codes()` to map a vector of codes from one clinical coding system to another:

```{r}
map_codes(codes = "G20..",
          from = "read2",
          to = "icd10",
          all_lkps_maps = all_lkps_maps_dummy)
```

Alternatively, use `get_mapping_df()` to return a mapping data frame:

```{r}
get_mapping_df(from = "read3",
               to = "icd10",
               all_lkps_maps = all_lkps_maps_dummy)
```

# Filters

Mapping between different clinical coding systems is not perfect and should be manually reviewed. Some mapping tables list multiple possible code mappings, with a separate column indicating the type of mapping.[^1] For example, the Read 2 to Read 3 mapping table includes an 'IS_ASSURED' column, where '1' and '0' indicate that a code mapping is or is not assured respectively:

[^1]: Refer to the accompanying documentation for [UKB resource 592](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/refer.cgi?id=592 "Clinical coding classification systems and maps") for further details.

```{r}
all_lkps_maps_dummy$read_v2_read_ctv3 %>% 
  dplyr::select(READV2_CODE,
                READV3_CODE,
                IS_ASSURED)
```

Similarly, the Read 3 to ICD10 mapping table includes 'mapping_status' and 'refine_flag' columns:

```{r}
all_lkps_maps_dummy$read_ctv3_icd10 %>% 
  dplyr::select(read_code:refine_flag)
```

It is important to decide which mappings to include. For example, if no filters are applied then the Read 3 code for sebaceous cyst 'XaIP9' will map to a number of ICD10 codes, some of which are sex-specific ('N508' and 'N948'):

```{r}
map_codes(codes = "XaIP9",
          from = "read3",
          to = "icd10",
          all_lkps_maps = all_lkps_maps_dummy,
          col_filters = NULL)
```

Default filters are applied by `default_col_filters()`:

```{r}
map_codes(codes = "XaIP9",
          from = "read3",
          to = "icd10",
          all_lkps_maps = all_lkps_maps_dummy,
          col_filters = default_col_filters())
```
