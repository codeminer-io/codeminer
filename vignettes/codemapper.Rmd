# Introduction

The goal of codemapper is to simplify working with clinical codes for research using electronic health records. The first step is to create a local database containing lookup and mapping tables for various clinical coding systems:

```{r eval = FALSE}
all_lkps_maps <- build_all_lkps_maps()
```
